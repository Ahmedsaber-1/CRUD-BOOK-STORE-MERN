A MERN stack-based CRUD Bookstore app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete book entries seamlessly. Built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, the app provides a full-stack solution for managing a bookstore's database and frontend interface.

Features:

CRUD Operations:

Create: Users can add new books to the inventory, including details.
Read: View book entries, including detailed information on each book.
Update: Edit book details, such as the title, author.
Delete: Remove books from the inventory when no longer needed.

Built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS, the app features a modern, responsive user interface that works across devices.

Backend Integration:

Express.js handles API routes for CRUD operations, interacting with MongoDB to store and retrieve data.

React Router DOM allows smooth and dynamic navigation between different sections of the app (Home, Book List, Add New Book, Edit Book, etc.).
API Requests:

Axios is used for handling HTTP requests to interact with the backend API for book data management.
